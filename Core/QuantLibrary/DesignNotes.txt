How to deal with the position / trade / conundrum?

Option 1)
    We're mocking out high level risk calcs; individual trades don't really matter, let's just deal with positions as (Instrument, Counterparty) * quantity
    

Option 2)
    Model trades, aggregate in place
    
Option 3) 
    Have an IPosition interface, and implement Option 1 for now?
    
    
    
======================

TODO
done 0 Is there a units library I can use instead? Or should I just ditch units / nonunited stuff? 
    - No, implemented my own units library, that works 
done, needs testing - FX handling
done - Build out BS models as a next step    
done - test them against online calculators like  https://goodcalculators.com/black-scholes-calculator/

=======================

What are the actual units on the greeks?

A stock price is really Currency / Share
An option price is really Currency / Option
But the instrument part is usually glossed over, so we'd say a price is just a currency

Delta

Taylor series is
 
price(t1) = price(t0) + delta * (underlying_price(t1) - underlying_price(t0))
          = Ccy/instrument + delta * Ccy/instrument

so the unit of delta is 1,  
assuming we consistently treat prices as ccy/instrument

Gamma

Taylor series is
 
price(t1) = delta_expansion + 0.5 * gamma * (underlying_price(t1) - underlying_price(t0)) ^ 2
          = ccy/instrument + 0.5 * gamma * ccy^2 / instrument^2

so the unit of gamma is Instr / Ccy, or 1/Ccy if we use implicit instruments

Vega
price(t1) = price(t0) + vega * (vol(t1) - vol(t0)) 
vols are unitless, so the unit of vega must be the same as price, i.e. Currency/Instrument 

Theta
price(t1) = price(t0) + theta * 1 day 

So, either we introduce time as a unit, in which case the unit theta is Currency/(Instrument * Day), or we treat
time as unitless, in which case it's Currency/Instrument 


Rho
price(t1) = price(t0) + rho * (r(t1) - r(t0)) 
rates are unitless, so the unit of rho must be the same as price, i.e. Currency/Instrument
